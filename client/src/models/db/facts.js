  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mercury",
    fact: "Mercury is known as the Water Star by the Ancient Chinese. Despite being the closest planet to the sun and one of the hottest places in the solar system, it is, in fact, subject to enormous temperature fluctuations. It has no atmosphere to retain heat so Mercury’s poles and the nightside of the planet plunge well below even the coldest temperatures recorded on Earth. With some regions never getting above -170°C, conditions are perfect for ice to form. Mercury’s regolith is home to possibly a trillion tonnes of ice, which would make it one of the wettest places in the solar system."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mercury",
    fact: "Mercury contains the largest man made crater in space. NASA’s MESSENGER probe was orbiting the planet for 6 years and ran out of fuel in 2014. It could no longer correct its course and as its orbit decayed, it got closer to the planet, and much faster. The resulting crash occurred at over 8000mph and left a crater over 50ft wide, easily the biggest man made crater anywhere in the universe. Apart from Earth!"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mercury",
    fact: "Mercury's day is longer than its year. Because Mercury orbits so close to the sun it rotates three times on its axis every two years. This makes each 'day' (as in sunrise to sunset and back to sunrise) on Mercury last two of its years. It’s a weird day too - the sun would rise, then go backwards in the sky and set, then rise again before finally setting a year later. The next year, the sun would move in the opposite direction. This is why there the aliens all left, they could not make a suitable calendar to tell what day it was."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mercury",
    fact: "Mercury smells like wet metallic bottom burps. Mercury’s small size means it has no permanent atmosphere - its gravity is too weak to hold onto any gas in the wake of the strong solar wind. However, it does have a remarkably strong magnetic field which means it keeps a hold of whatever ions come its way. Planets, like Earth, are nice and oxygen filled whereas Mercury’s atmosphere contains things planets normally don’t hang on to. There are a lot of ions in that part of space like magnesium, calcium, sodium, as well as unusual ions of water and hydrogen sulphide."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Venus",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Venus, they all left and settled in Scotland. In the same neighbourhood of the solar system as Earth it is the closest planet to us and is nearly the same size and has nearly the same gravity. It has mountains and valleys from tectonic activity and a complex weather system in its thick atmosphere. By all measures, it is our twin, our evil twin. Venus is the hottest place in the solar system (aside from the sun), with punishing 450°C temperatures, clouds that consists of sulphuric acid which block out the sun, rain and snow made from toxic lead compounds, and an atmospheric pressure nearly a hundred times that of Earth. The effect would be like being boiled alive while being hugged by the Incredible Hulk while your skin dissolves. The surface is so horrible that for years, the probes we sent there were crushed, then melted. Venus doesn’t tilt on its axis, so it doesn’t have seasons and every day is the hottest day. Still, the upper clouds are rather pleasant, as the atmosphere is so dense, oxygen would float on Venus just as helium does on Earth so perhaps cities in the clouds are an option for the future?"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Venus",
    fact: "Much like Mercury, Venus has a weird calendar. Its year of 225 days isn’t too different to Earth’s, its rotation is very slow and probably due to a large impact during its formation, it rotates backwards very slowly. If you could see it thourgh the coulds of sulphuric acid, you would notice the sun setting twice in the east."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Venus",
    fact: "Veuns glows at night, although no one is quite sure why. The effect is very subtle, but there is a distinct glow on the night side. Some believe it to be lightning storms so violent they light up the sky others believe it to be bonfires being lit to celebrate the coronation of a new Venusian emperor, or the slash and burn of Venusian farmers."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Earth",
    fact: "The core of the Earth is a solid lump of nickel and iron, rotating in a sea of molten iron and nickel. This rotating is the same as winding up a hand held generator giving the Earth an enormous magnetic field. This magnetic field extends up to 50,000km out into space and is crucial for life on Earth. Without it we would be exposed to the full force of the Sun’s radiation which, as well as causing cancers and other radiation aggravated conditions, our atmosphere would be blown into space. This is what happened to Mercury, and to a lesser extent, Mars. Instead, charged particles are (mostly) harmlessly deflected away, giving rise to the auroras."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Earth",
    fact: "Earth is not the biggest planet in the system but it is the biggest rocky planet in the solar system, and also the densest. Earth has by far the highest surface gravity of any terrestrial object in the solar system. The reason for the high density is the large deposits of heavy elements in the Earth’s makeup. Elements like lead and uranium are much less common on other worlds which gives us a huge advantage in the amount and variety of construction projects available to us on Earth. High gravity makes Earth the worst place in the solar system for space exploration. The sheer cost of overcoming Earth’s gravity each launch has been the single biggest barrier to space travel. To put it into perspective, if the Earth only had the same gravity as the Moon, a typical aeroplane would be fast enough to get into orbit."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Earth",
    fact: "Most planets in the solar system have moons, and the Moon may not be the biggest of them, but in comparison to Earth it's enormous. Most scientists think that rather than coalescing on its own like the other large moons, it was violently shorn off Earth billions of years ago by a collision with another planet. The impact - with a planet about the size of Mars - liquified Earth in the heat, and the Moon broke off and cooled into a ball of rock from this molten planet. The Moon’s size and distance are a giant cosmic coincidence, which means that on Earth we can experience total eclipses, annular eclipses and partial eclipses, all from the comfort of our own planet. If the Moon were more in proportion, it would be too small for any sort of eclipse at all."

  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Earth",
    fact: "Despite attempts to show otherwise, Earth is the only place in the universe we can be sure that there is life. With liquid water, oxygen and plenty of sunlight, conditions for life are improbably ideal. We know this to be true as all the Aliens from the other planets have settled here. Have you seen Men in Black? True story!"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mars",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Mars, they all left and settled in England. Nicknamed the red planet because it is covered with rust-like dust and the atmosphere is a pinkish red, colored by tiny particles of dust thrown up from the surface. Mars experiences violent dust storms which continually change its surface"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mars",
    fact: "Mars has many massive volcanoes and is home to Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in our solar system, it stands 21km high and is 600km across the base. It has many channels, plains and canyons on the surface which could have been caused by water erosion in the past."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Mars",
    fact: "Mars has very weak gravity which cannot hold onto the atmosphere well so has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide. It is not thick enough to trap the sun's heat like Venus, so the planet is very cold. Temperatures range from -120 Degrees Celsius on winter nights to 25 Degrees Celsius in the summer. Its polar ice caps consist of frozen Co2 (dry ice) which lies over a layer of ice."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Jupiter",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Jupiter, they all left and settled across Scandanavia. Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar system. It is so big that more than 1300 Earths could fit inside it. At the centre of Jupiter is a rocky core, slightly bigger than Earth but weighing about 20 times more. Surrounding the core is an ocean of liquid hydrogen, about 1,000 kilometres deep."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Jupiter",
    fact: "Thick, colorful clouds of deadly poisonous gases surround Jupiter. The quick spinning of the planet whips up the atmosphere, creating the bands around the planet. If you were to descend into Jupiter, the thin, cold atmosphere becomes thicker and hotter, gradually turning into a thick, dark fog. In the blackness about 1000km down the pressure squeezes the atmosphere so hard that it becomes like liquid."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Jupiter",
    fact: "Jupiter has many storms raging on the surface, most notably the big red spot which is the largest hurricane in our Solar System. It's been raging for over three hundred years."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Jupiter",
    fact: "Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, you would weigh two and a half times as much as you would on Earth. Jupiter has many moons circling around it. Four of these moons are bigger than Pluto."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Saturn",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Saturn, they all left and settled across the Middle East. Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system and is another gas giant. It has a small rocky core covered with liquid gas. It is surrounded by a system of rings that stretch out into space for thousands of kilometres. The rings are made up of millions of ice crystals, some as big as houses and others as small as specks of dust."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Saturn",
    fact: "Saturn is very light as it is made up of more hydrogen than helium so it is less dense. If we could fit Saturn into a bathtub it would float (but that would have to be one big bathtub!)"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Saturn",
    fact: "Saturn is not a peaceful planet. Storm winds race around the atmosphere at 800kmp/h. Saturn has a very strong magnetic field which traps energy particles resulting in high levels of radiation. Like Jupiter, Saturn has many moons which surround it."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Uranus",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Uranus, they all left and settled across Africa. Uranus spins lying on its side (like a barrel), this is perhaps due to a large collision early in its formation. It was the first planet discovered by telescope"
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Uranus",
    fact: "Since Uranus takes 84 Earth years to go around the sun, this means that each of its poles is in daylight for 42 years and in darkness for the next 42."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Uranus",
    fact: "Uranus’s atmosphere is mostly hydrogen but it also contains large amounts of a gas called methane. Methane absorbs red light and scatters blue light so a blue-green methane haze hides the interior of the planet from view. "
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Uranus",
    fact: "Uranus hides its interior but scientists guess that under the hydrogen-methane atmosphere is a hot, slushy ocean of water, ammonia and methane thousands of miles deep wrapped around a rocky core."

  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Neptune",
    fact: "There are no Aliens on Neptune, they all left and settled in Asia. Neptune is a large planet, nearly four times the size of Earth."

  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Neptune",
    fact: "Neptune suffers the most violent weather in our Solar System. Storms have been spotted swirling around its surface and freezing winds that blow about ten times faster than hurricanes on Earth make it the windiest planet."
  },
  {
    type: "Planet",
    name: "Neptune",
    fact: "Neptune is a large, water planet with a blue hydrogen-methane atmosphere and faint rings. It is covered in thin wispy white clouds which stretch out around the planet."
